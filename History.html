<h1 id="history-and-geography-of-rajasthan"><a class="header" href="#history-and-geography-of-rajasthan">History and Geography of Rajasthan</a></h1>
<p>The history of Rajasthan is about 5000 years old and the mythological origin of this gigantic land is related to the famous myth of Ram, the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. In the ancient period, Rajasthan was a part of different dynasties including the Mauryan Empire. The first batch of Aryans who came to India settled in the region of &quot;Dundhmer&quot; and the first inhabitants of this area were the &quot;Bheels&quot; and the &quot;Meenas&quot;. The earliest Rajput dynasty that emerged around 700 AD was the &quot;Gurjars&quot; and &quot;Partiharas&quot; and since then Rajasthan was known as Rajputana. Soon, the Rajput clan gained supremacy and the Rajputs were divided into 36 royal clans and 21 dynasties. The armed conflicts and the struggle for supremacy among the &quot;Parmars&quot;, &quot;Chalukyas&quot;, and &quot;Chauhans&quot; resulted in a lot of bloodshed.
In the medieval era, the major regions of the state such as Nagaur, Ajmer and Ranthambhore became a part of the Mughal Empire, which was headed by Akbar. The most famous Rajput warriors of this era were Rana Uday Singh, his son MahaRana Pratap, Bhappa Rawal, Rana Kumbha and Prithviraj Chauhan. With the end of the Mughal regime in 1707, the Marathas gained supremacy and captured Ajmer in 1775. The Maratha ascendancy ended in the late 17th century with the arrival of Britishers. The present state of Rajasthan was formed in the year 1956.
Geographically Rajasthan is located in the northwest India. The state has an area of 342,239 square kilometers. The state has rhomboid shape with length of 869 km. from west to east and 826 km. from north to south. Rajasthan shares its border with Pakistan, while Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh bound Rajasthan in north and east, and Gujarat in south-west.</p>

<h1 id="civilizations-of-rajasthan"><a class="header" href="#civilizations-of-rajasthan">Civilizations of Rajasthan</a></h1>
<p>Rajasthan's civilisation is still preserved in Kalibangan, a town on the banks of the Ghaggar River of Hanumangarh district, Bikaner. Thar Desert has existence of Indus Valley Civillization and the remnants of the pre-Harappan and Harappan settlements.Realm of Kalibangan has many archaeological evidences which show that Rajasthan had once been an important centre of the ceramic industry.The paintings on the ancient pottery bear close resemblance to the Harappan designs. Contemporary pottery of Rajasthan has a distinct influence of the Indus Valley ceramic industry and related handicrafts. Indus Valley Civillization flourished on the banks of Saraswatiriver.</p>
<p><img src="assets/civilizations1.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Transformation of this land took place after the mighty river changed its course and finally dried up due to the immensity of the encroaching desert. The land silently slipped into Thar desertwith whole civillisation buried in it.</p>
